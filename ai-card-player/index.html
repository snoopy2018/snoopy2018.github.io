      <p>Practice your rational reasoning and take it to the next level. Do you know the card game SET? The card game trains your visual perception and logical thinking. Do you or your child want to learn SET and sharpen your skills?  We have developed the <em>AI Card Player</em> learning app for you, with which you can learn and master this fascinating and entertaining game. </p>

      <p>This computer vision app imitates human vision and logical thinking through your phone’s camera and computer system. The idea was born at Laurelwood Elementary School in Santa Clara, California. As a volunteer, I played SET with second grade students during math classes. While playing, we were often faced with situations where we asked ourselves: is this really a set? Is there a set at all? Are there any more sets? How many sets can we find? Our app <em>AI Card Player</em> is now trying to answer these questions.</p>

        <!-- The <em>AI Card Player</em> mobile app is a computer vision application with which you can learn and master the SET card game, which in turn trains visual perception and logical thinking.</p>

      <p>The app is based on the idea to imitate human vision and logical thinking through a camera and a computer system. The idea of actually building an app was born at Laurelwood Elementary School in Santa Clara, California. As a volunteer, I would play SET with second grade students during math classes.</p>

      <p><em>AI Card Player</em> works as follows. It analyses in real-time video images either from your phone's camera or from a file. It recognizes cards by their four "features" (SET nomenclature): color, shape, shading, and number. Moreover, it visualizes why three cards form a set and why not, which makes it easier to understand the SET game rules.</p>

      <p>Not sure if there is a set, or none, or how many? No problem, the app finds all possible sets in a group of recognized cards and shows them to you. And in case you need a little help, it will give you a hint on how to find a set. <em>AI Card Player</em> will turn your mobile phone into a teammate of a fascinating and entertaining game.</p> -->

            <p>The app <em>AI Card Player</em> provides you with hints whenever you need them. A hint is based on sets in a scene, cards you've selected, and sets you've already found. It has four detail levels. At level one, a hint shows either color, shape, shading, or number of three cards that form a set. The level increases after you've checked different card combinations that didn't form a set. At level four, you'll see all four features: color, shape, shading, and number. Or in other words, the full disclosure of a set.</p>

            <p>The app needs to recognize all cards precisely. One obstacle might be a color cast caused by lighting conditions (e.g., the blue sky or artificial light), which the camera's internal white balance system couldn't resolve completely. However, the app can adapt to those conditions if you let it know card background color.</p>

            <p>Tap with your fingertip on the phone's screen (longer than 0.5 seconds). A rectangle with a sample area in the center will appear. Drag it to any card background. The app will analyze its color and then mark recognized cards by either a red, green, or purple dot.</p>

            <p>You may use this feature to measure a color composition of any object in an image (RGB color model). The sample monitor displays arithmetic means of red, green, and blue light intensities of a sample area.</p>

            <p>As you gain more experience with SET and our app, you may want to challenge yourself, create and explore card scenes, or try to solve problems with the help of <em>AI Card Player</em>. Consider the following. What is the maximum number of sets you can find in a group of N cards? Find a group of 6 cards that consists of 4 sets. Find 20 cards that do <em>not</em> form any set.</p>

        <h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
        <p>The following guidelines helped us during development to achieve high card recognition rates, and we hope they will help you to have the best experience, too.</p>

        <!-- <p>[ <em>You may want to add to each of the items a symbol or image that visualizes the words (fun and probably more memorable).</em> ]
        </p>  -->

        <ul>
          <li>Hold your camera parallel to a card surface, otherwise shapes become distorted and difficult to recognize.</li>

          <li>Keep your camera as steady as possible. Sudden movements blur images that make it impossible to classify card features. A rough tap on the <span class="itemToSelect">Pause</span> button, while using the camera, may also blur the image.</li>

          <li>Use proper lighting for your scene. Objects in the dark are less distinguishable.</li>

          <li>If you observe an extreme color cast, use the app's color cast filter which adapts to the color of the light source. </li>

          <li>Avoid specular highlights. A game card has a reflective surface, similar to a mirror. If you observe a specular highlight on card images (an area without texture), try to move the camera until all cards are outside the spotlight. Or, if possible, block direct light to prevent specular reflection and mainly use diffuse reflected light, for example, from a  wall or ceiling.</li>

          <li>Please be patient if the app doesn't recognize all cards immediately. Little adjustments, for instance, a slightly different angle between phone and card surface, may already improve recognition rates.</li>

          <li>The app draws a colored dot at the center of each recognized card. Use the dots as a first indicator whether or not cards get recognized correctly. The dot color indicates the color feature, and the dot's position the number feature of a card.</li>

          <li>Always keep in mind, your smart phone doesn't see objects as your eye-brain system lets you perceive them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>
        <p>Feel free to download videos to your iPhone from the collection below. A video will allow you to play at times where you don't have a deck of SET cards at hand. But remember, you can create these kind of videos  yourself any time when you've cards in front of you.</p>

        <p>In case your Safari browser doesn't let you download a video to your iPhone (e.g., Safari on iOS 12.4), we recommend to use the Firefox browser instead. The procedure is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>On your iPhone, in Firefox, navigate to any video from collection below.</li>
          <li>Tap on <span class="itemToSelect">Download Video</span> (longer than 0.5 s).</li>
          <li>Select <span class="itemToSelect">Download Link</span>.</li>
          <li>Select <span class="itemToSelect">Download Now</span>. By default, Firefox will store the video file in a folder called <span class="itemToSelect">Downloads</span>.</li>
