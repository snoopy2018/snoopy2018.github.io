            <h2 id="introducing">Introducing the Artificial Intelligent Card Player</h2>
            <p>Practice your rational reasoning and take it to the next level. <em>AI Card Player</em> is a computer vision app that assists you to learn and master SET, a card game of visual perception (app runs on an iPhone). It analyses images from camera or file, identifies card features (color, shape, shading, and number), visualizes game rules, and gives hints for finding a set. The app represents an artificial intelligent player or assistant who knows in a group of cards <em>all</em> triplets that form a set.</p>

            <p>This is a paragraph that visualizes <span class="testing">a line length of approximately</span> 36 to 66 characters. Bringhurst recommends that a line shall be closer to 36 than to 66 characters long (\cite{Bringhurst:2013}, p.167). I've read in web design books that a breakpoint at 36 em is reasonable, which confirms Bringhurst's statement.</p>

            <h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
            <p>The following previews demonstrate core features of the app. The yellow spots symbolize how the user interacts with the app (taps that close a view are not shown).</p>
