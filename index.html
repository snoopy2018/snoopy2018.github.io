      In CSS:
        .javascript .someClass { statement if enabled }  (2)

Bringhurst recommends that a line shall be closer to 36 than to 66 characters long (\cite{Bringhurst:2013}, p.167). I've read in web design books that a breakpoint at 36 em is reasonable, which confirms Bringhurst's statement.</p>  -->

      <p><img src="media/images/appLogo.png" id="appLogo" alt="App logo" width="100"> Practice your rational reasoning and take it to the next level. <em>AI Card Player</em> is a computer vision app that runs on iPhone devices. It helps you to learn and master SET, a card game of visual perception. It analyses images captured by camera or from file, identifies color, shape, shading, and number of cards, visualizes game rules, and provides hints for finding a set. The app turns your phone into a companion of an fascinating and fun card game.</p>

      <h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
      <p>The following previews demonstrate main features of the app. The animation of yellow disks represent user's fingertip tapping or dragging elements on screen (for simplicity's sake, taps that close a view are not shown).</p>

              <p>Tap (longer than 0.5 seconds) with your fingertip on the phone's screen. A rectangle with the sample area in the center will appear. Drag the sample area to any card background. The app will mark cards that it recognizes with either a red, green, or purple dot.</p>

              <p>You may use this feature to measure color of colored objects in an image, which you may perceive as white. The sample monitor displays red, green, and blue (RGB) colors of the sample area (arithmetic means).</p>

        <h2 id="bestPractices">Best Practices</h2>
        <p>The app needs good quality images as input for best results. The following guidelines helped us during development to achieve high card recognition rates, and we hope they will help you to have the best experience with our app.</p>

        <!-- <p>[ <em>You may want to add to each of the items a symbol or image that visualizes the words (fun and probably more memorable).</em> ]
        </p>  -->

        <ul>
          <li>Hold your camera parallel to the card surface, otherwise shapes become distorted and difficult to recognize.</li>
          <li>Keep your camera as steady as possible. Sudden movements blur images that makes it impossible to classify card features.</li>

          <li>Use proper lighting for your scene. Dark objects are less distinguishable.</li>

          <li>Avoid specular highlights. A game card has a reflective surface and acts similar to a mirror. If you observe a specular highlight on card images (area without texture), try to move your camera until the bright spot is outside of the card image. Another option is to block direct light to prevent specular reflection and use only diffuse reflected light, for example, from a  wall or ceiling. (Taking a photograph of reflective surfaces can be challenging task in photography.)</li>

          <li>If you observe an extreme color cast, use the app's color filter that adapts to the light source's color. </li>

          <li>Please be patient if the app doesn't recognize all cards. Little adjustments, for instance, a slightly different angle between phone and card surface, may yield already to better results.</li>

          <li>Use the colored markers, which the app draws on each card it recognizes, as a first indicator whether cards get identified correctly.</li>

          <li>Always keep in mind that your phone doesn't see objects as you perceive them by your eye-brain system.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>
        <p>The video collection of card scenes below will help you to get started in case you don't have a deck of cards at hand. Feel free to download them to your iPhone.</p>

        <p>As of this writing (November 2019, iOS 12.4.3), Firefox is surprisingly the only browser that allows you to download and save a video on your iPhone. Thus we need to ask you to use Firefox for this procedure: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In Firefox on your iPhone, select any of the videos below.</li>
          <li>Tap (longer than 0.5 s) on download symbol.</li>
          <li>Choose from menu <em>Download Link</em>.</li>
          <li>Choose from menu <em>Download Now</em>. By default, Firefox is going to store the video in folder <em>Downloads</em>.</li>
          <li>Either tap immediately on <em>Downloads</em>, or navigate to folder by <em>Settings </em> &rarr; <em>Your Library</em> &rarr; <em>Downloads</em>.</li>
          <li>Select video, then choose from menu <em>Save Video</em>. Firefox will add a copy to your Photos library.</li>
          <li>Done.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Alternatively, if you have access to an Apple desktop or laptop computer, use your favorite browser and click on any of the <em>Download Video</em> buttons below, it will start off the download process; after downloading, open video (e.g., with QuickTime Player) and share it with your iPhone (<em>File</em> &rarr; <em>Share</em>).</p>

        <p>All videos have MPG-4 format and a file sizes of approximately 1 MB (duration about 0.2 seconds; length is sufficient because app analyses each video frame).</p>
