Bringhurst recommends that a line shall be closer to 36 than to 66 characters long (\cite{Bringhurst:2013}, p.167).

      <p><img src="media/images/appLogo.png" id="appLogo" alt="App logo" width="100"> Practice your rational reasoning and take it to the next level. AI Card Player is a computer vision app that runs on iPhone devices and helps you to learn and master the card game SET. Card Player analyses images from camera or file, identifies color, shape, shading, and number of cards, visualizes game rules, and provides hints for finding sets. The app turns your iPhone into a companion of a fascinating and fun card game.</p>

      <h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
      <p>The following previews demonstrate main features of the app. The animation of yellow disks represent user's fingertip tapping or dragging elements on screen (for simplicity's sake, taps that close a view are not shown).</p>

              <p>You may use this feature to measure the color composition of any object in an image. The sample monitor displays red, green, and blue (RGB) colors of the sample area (arithmetic means).</p>

        <h2 id="bestPractices">Best Practices</h2>
        <p>The app needs good quality images as input for best results. The following guidelines helped us during development to achieve high card recognition rates, and we hope they will help you to have the best experience with Card Player.</p>

        <!-- <p>[ <em>You may want to add to each of the items a symbol or image that visualizes the words (fun and probably more memorable).</em> ]
        </p>  -->

        <ul>
          <li>Hold your camera parallel to the card surface, otherwise shapes become distorted and difficult to recognize.</li>
          <li>Keep your camera as steady as possible. Sudden movements blur images that makes it impossible to classify card features.</li>

          <li>Use proper lighting for your scene. Dark objects are less distinguishable.</li>

          <li>If you observe an extreme color cast, use the app's color cast filter that adapts to the light source's color. </li>

          <li>Avoid specular highlights. A game card has a reflective surface, similar to a mirror. If you observe a specular highlight on card images (area without texture), try to move the camera until all cards are outside the spotlight. Or block direct light, if possible, to prevent specular reflection and use only diffuse reflected light, for example, from a  wall or ceiling.</li>

          <li>Please be patient if the app doesn't recognize all cards. Little adjustments, for instance, a slightly different angle between phone and card surface, may already yield to better results.</li>

          <li>Use the colored markers, which the app draws on each recognized card, as a first indicator whether cards get identified correctly.</li>

          <li>Always keep in mind that your phone doesn't see objects as you perceive them by your eye-brain system.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>
        <p>The video collection below consists of card scenes you can download to your iPhone and start to play with, in case you don't have a deck of cards at hand.</p>

        <p>As of this writing (November 2019, iOS 12.4.3), Firefox is surprisingly the only browser that allows to download and save a video on your iPhone. Thus we need to ask you to use Firefox for this procedure: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>On your iPhone, navigate in Firefox to any of the videos below.</li>
          <li>Tap (longer than 0.5 s) on <span class="itemToSelect">Download Video</span> button.</li>
          <li>Select <span class="itemToSelect">Download Link</span>.</li>
          <li>Select <span class="itemToSelect">Download Now</span>. By default, Firefox is going to store the video in folder <span class="itemToSelect">Downloads</span>.</li>
          <li>Either tap immediately on <span class="itemToSelect">Downloads</span>, or navigate to that folder: select <span class="itemToSelect">Settings </span> &gt; <span class="itemToSelect">Your Library</span> &gt; <span class="itemToSelect">Downloads</span>.</li>
          <li>Choose video, then select <span class="itemToSelect">Save Video</span>. Firefox will add a copy to your Photos library.</li>
          <li>Done.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Alternatively, if you have access to an Apple desktop or laptop computer, use your favorite browser and click on any of the <span class="itemToSelect">Download Video</span> buttons below, it will start off the download process; after downloading, open video, for example, with QuickTime Player and share it with your iPhone (in QuickTime Player choose <span class="itemToSelect">File</span> &gt; <span class="itemToSelect">Share</span>).</p>

        <p>All videos have MPG-4 format and a file sizes of approximately 1 MB (duration about 0.2 seconds).</p>
